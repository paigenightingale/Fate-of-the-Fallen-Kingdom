<h2> About the Character</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Context of the character</h3>
  <p> The prince/princess is from a distant kingdom, a peaceful and prosperous land that lies far beyond the magical mirror they discovered. Their life was that of luxury and tranquility, until one day, while exploring their castle’s ancient chambers, they uncovered a long-forgotten magic mirror. Drawn to its mystique, they unknowingly activated it and were transported to this strange new world—a place of dragons, ancient magic, and political turmoil, where an evil queen reigns with terror. With no way to return home, they now find themselves caught between their desire to escape and the responsibility to help free this magical land from the queen’s rule. Along the way, they discover that their journey may be tied to the fate of this world, and the mirror that brought them here may hold more secrets than they first imagined.</p>
  <h3>Personality</h3>
  <p>The prince/princess is a curious and resilient soul, driven by an unwavering desire to return home but also to explore the land they've been thrust into. They're adaptable, with an open mind and a quick wit, able to connect with both the common folk and magical beings they meet. While their royal upbringing gave them a sense of duty and responsibility, they aren't arrogant—having grown up with the knowledge that their true power lies in understanding and compassion, not just royal blood. Their kindness is often paired with a quiet determination to do what’s right, even when it means making difficult or dangerous choices. They're thoughtful but quick to take action when needed, especially when it comes to saving innocent lives or standing up against injustice.</p>
