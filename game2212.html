<h4>You keep running fast and far as they are still chasing you</h4>
<h4>You come to a ledge and have no time to stop before you jump off</h4>
<h4>Luckily you have jumped out into a waterfall with a lake underneath</h4>
<h4>However as you land and swim to the surface you discovered you have landed in the territory of dragon trainers</h4>
<h5>What do you do?</h5>
