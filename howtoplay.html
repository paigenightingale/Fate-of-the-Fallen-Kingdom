 <h2> How to play</h2>
 <div class="howtoplay">
    <p>This game is a choice game where your decisions depends on whether you live to defeat the Evil Queen or be consumed by power.</p></p>
    <p>At key moments in the game, youâ€™ll be presented with multiple-choice decisions. Each choice will affect the outcome of the story and your relationships with other characters.</p>
    <p>The choices you make will determine your survival, reputation, and how events unfold. Some decisions will have immediate consequences, while others will shape the long-term course of your journey.</P>
    <p>Be careful! Some choices could lead to danger, betrayal, or even death. But remember, every decision is an opportunity to shape your destiny.</p>
    <p>Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!</p>
